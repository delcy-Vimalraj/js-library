    <p>Management refers to series of functions for the organization and administration of various
        activities and people
        in the organization. Management is essential for all types of organization and libraries are no
        exception.
        Libraries had very limited financial resources and limited services. Now libraries exist in
        great
        variety. These
        vary in size, goals, structural pattern, financial resources, staff and many other
        characteristics.
        From
        management point of view, these very in management style, morale of the staff, environment for
        innovation, etc.
        Now a variety of information and communication technologies are available as means to improve
        library services
        and operations.Library management textbooks in the United States primarily discuss the purpose
        of
        library
        management, its principles, history, management theories, and organisations. A notable
        characteristic of library
        management theories is that they primarily used management theories meant for commercial
        organisations to
        describe themselves. It can be observed that the management theories developed for business
        organisations and
        the management theories developed for libraries make up the majority, and the largest percentage
        are
        those aimed
        at business organisations </p>

        One can see that citations of management theories meant for commercial organisations increased
        greatly between
        the first edition (1977) and the fifth edition (1998). Management theories developed for
        libraries
        were also
        cited increasingly between the first edition (1977) and the sixth edition (2002). Though both
        the
        theories meant
        for commercial organisations and those meant for the libraries have been cited less in the
        seventh
        edition
        (2007) of the library management textbook, this is due to a change in the editorial policy.

        Management theories intended for non-profit organisations were cited much less often than other
        management
        theories. By comparing the rate at which they are being cited, we can see that between the first
        edition (1977)
        and the fourth edition (1993), there has been an increase in the rate of citations for
        management
        theories
        concerning commercial organisations. Since the fifth edition (1998), there has also been a
        decline
        in the number
        of citations of management theories meant for commercial organisations. However, this does not
        change the fact
        that the overall trend has been that management theories designed for commercial organisations
        have
        been cited
        with greater frequency than the others
